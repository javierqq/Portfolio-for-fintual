# Portfolio-for-fintual
Exercise to apply for a job at fintual

**GOAL**

Construct a simple Portfolio class that has a collection of Stocks. Assume each Stock has a “Current Price” method that receives the last available price. Also, the Portfolio class has a collection of “allocated” Stocks that represents the distribution of the Stocks the Portfolio is aiming (i.e. 40% META, 60% APPL)
Provide a portfolio rebalance method to know which Stocks should be sold and which ones should be bought to have a balanced Portfolio based on the portfolio’s allocation.
Add documentation/comments to understand your thinking process and solution

To accomplish this I used tools thought to be appropiate and didn't restrict myself to create further functionalities to either test, as a script to test my code for example, or develop what I thought was needed, or would be nice to have, to accomplish the task at hand. 
I also used Vite to create the proyect: https://vite.dev/guide/; and finnhub's API to get real time stock prices: https://finnhub.io/docs/api/introduction


_disclaimer:_ I have not much experience with javascript, althought I believe logic can be transfered from one languaje to another, so I chose as sort of a challenge to use JS as a languaje and related tools.
